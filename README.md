Low-level vision and high-level vision are commonly thought to be the two subsystems that make up machine vision systems. Low-level vision usually entails processing the incoming image and producing a higher-quality image that is easier to work with machines. Choosing an optimal gray level threshold for differentiating objects from their backgrounds is fundamental in low-level image processing.

During the threshold implementation we used the following libraries:
```python
import os
import numpy as np
import cv2
import argparse
import ntpath
```
